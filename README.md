# arm3mk
I wrote this code in the Arduino IDE for the Arduino Nano board.

This code is written to control the EEZYbotArm MK3 by daGHIZmo.

The following components are used in the project:
1. Arduino Nano
2. 28BYJ-48 stepper motor x 3
3. ULN2003 driver board x 3
4. MG90D servo x 1
5. Joystick module x 2
6. Expansion shield for Arduino Nano

Also, for this code to work, the GyverJoy library will be required.
